# Project And App Structure for Django

This repository contains two templates: one for project structure and one for app structure.

You can use these by referring to their release files during project/app creation:

    django-admin startproject --template https://github.com/ephes/django-template/releases/download/0.1.0/project_template.zip <project_name>
    ./manage.py startapp --template https://github.com/ephes/django-template/releases/download/0.1.0/app_template.zip <app_name>
